# Advanced üôÇFace Recognition System for üßë‚ÄçüéìStudent Attendance

This project is an advanced face recognition system designed for managing student attendance in educational institutions. The system utilizes **Python 3.8.5** along with the **OpenCV library** for face detection and recognition. It offers a range of features for managing student data, capturing attendance through face recognition, and generating attendance reports.

## üíª Requirements

- **Python 3.8.5**

## üßê Algorithms Used

- **Haarcascade OpenCV (Object Detection)**
- **LBPH OpenCV (Face Recognition)**

## ‚úàÔ∏è Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: The system can detect faces in real-time using the Haarcascade OpenCV algorithm.
- **Face Recognition**: It uses LBPH OpenCV for recognizing individual faces based on trained samples.
- **Login Security System**: Includes a login system with username and password for secure access.
- **Student Management System**:
  - **Save**: Allows saving student information such as name, ID, and photo samples.
  - **Take Photo Samples**: Captures multiple photos of students for training the recognition model.
  - **Update**: Allows updating student information.
  - **Delete**: Removes a student from the system.
  - **Clear**: Clears all student data.
- **Train Photo Samples**: Trains the recognition model using the captured photo samples.
- **Take Attendance with Face Detection**: Marks attendance by detecting faces in a classroom setting.
- **Attendance Report**:
  - **Excel File**: Generates an Excel file containing attendance records.
  - **MySQL Database**: Stores attendance records in a MySQL database.
- **Developer Page**: Provides information about the developers and contributors.
- **Help Desk**: Offers assistance and support for using the system.
- **Exit System**: Allows users to securely log out of the system.
